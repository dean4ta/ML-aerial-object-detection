LECTURE 05 NOTES 1-25-18

TRAINING DATA:
- satellite image (--> rgb?)
- Digital Globe Database
- over Colombia, Missouri
- center points color-coded for each class
- .txt with exact center points of targets

GOAL:
detect and classify 4 classes:
- white cars,
- red cars,
- (blue) pools, and
- (green) ponds

DEVELOPMENT:
- preprocessing
- feature extraction
- model choice
- error metrics
- training
- evaluation
- hyperparameter tuning

FINAL METRICS:
- "generous" halo
- some summation that Mark came up with
- he couldn't explain what it meant after class
- just label stuff right and win
- alternatives:
  * precision+recall+accuracy
  * F-score or G-score
  * (Euclidian) distance from centroid

IDEAS:
- preprocessing
  * calibration, smoothing, noise reduction?
  * time, location, sunlight/shadows?
  * enforce size/location priors
    > cars are small, forests are large
	> cars do not belong in a forest
	> leveragee roads
  * consider image resolution
- feature extraction
  * superpixel segmentation
  * Haar-like features
- model choice
  * CNN component
  * adaptive boosting
  * SVM (and E-SVM?)
  * PCA + Bayesian background transform
- prediction
  * iterative adjustment of predicted target point
    > converge to some optimal center
